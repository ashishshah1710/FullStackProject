# FullStackProject

**Project Overview:**

* **Frontend:** The UI is developed using **React.js** under the project name **Store-UI**. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

* **Backend:** The backend, named **Chain Store**, is built using **Spring Boot** and **Java**. It handles the business logic, API endpoints, and data processing required for the application.

* **Database:** **MongoDB** is used as the primary database to store and manage application data. Its flexible document-based structure supports scalable and efficient data operations.

**Additional Features / Technologies:**

* RESTful APIs are used to enable communication between the frontend and backend.
* The backend is designed with a layered architecture for better code organization and maintainability.
* MongoDB's flexible schema design allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements.
* React hooks and state management libraries (such as Redux or Context API) are used to manage UI state efficiently.
* The application supports CRUD operations and follows best practices for full-stack development.
